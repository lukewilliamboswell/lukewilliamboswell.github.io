# Building a Text Editorâ€”Terminal UI

<time class="post-date" datetime="2024-03-14">14 Mar 2024</time> *~2 mins reading time*

I've added a text editor example using the [basic-cli](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli) platform to the [roc-ansi](https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-ansi) repository. The goal was a simple text editor that could be used to help teach functional programming.

If anyone is interested in developing a Terminal UI then I hope this example provides some good ideas.

Below is a demo of the text editor opening a new file called `abc.txt` and writing some content. I demonstrate a few features like saving the changes, undo and redo changes, and moving the cursor around the screen.

You can find the [example code](https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-ansi/blob/main/examples/text-editor.roc) located in the [roc-ansi](https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-ansi) repository.

If you have any feedback or suggestions please let me know.
